14th December 2016 - Version 3.2.0.1
  1. Moodle 3.2 beta version.
  2. For jQuery 3 needed to escape all '#'s and '"'s in the JS - ref: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/.
  3. Note: Having a single hash '#' for the URL for ARIA on the 'dropdown-toggle' link breaks jQuery like so:

Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #
    at Function.ga.error (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at ga.tokenize (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at ga.select (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at Function.ga [as find] (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at r.fn.init.find (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at r.fn.init (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at r (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)
    at c (first.js:232)
    at HTMLAnchorElement.toggle (first.js:232)
    at HTMLDocument.dispatch (jquery-3.1.0.min.js:1)

Set to the page URL.  This needs ARIA checking.  But... the call stack indicates issues with Bootstrap 2.3.2 code, so I suspect that
the decision to update to jQuery 3 was not so good in relation to supporting BS2.3.2 - need to investigate if bigger issue here.
